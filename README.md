##### **Dataset**
The dataset was sourced from Professor Jose R. Vilar from the University of Oviedo in Spain. A tri-axial accelerometer placed on the dominant wrist collected the dataset by wirelessly transferring the data to a computer at a sample rate of 16Hz and a range of 2g. In addition, a protocol describing partial motoric clonic epilepsy episodes was developed. This protocol sets up the forearm movements in relation to the upper arm, their approximate duration, intensity, and repeatability. Six participants were given identification numbers for anonymity and completed the protocol. The ages of the participants ranged from 22 to 47, with four participants about 40 years old. Only the older participant was left-handed.


##### **Approach**
**Preprocessing**: Simple Moving Average
**Feature Selection**
[DESCRIPTION]
**Classification**
[TT Split]
Machine Learning models SVM RBF, k-NN where k=5, Logistic Regression, and Naive Bayes were used and compared.

**Future Work**
The researcher aims to look into other means of classifying specifically using Deep Neural Networks, and identifying scientific questions about other aspects of the data.
